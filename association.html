                            <blockquote>Hello Data Scientist,<br><br>
                            We are potentially looking to re-jig the alcohol department within our store. Our customers are often complaining that they can't find the products
                            they want, and are also wanting recommendations about which other products they should try.<br>
                            On top of this, our marketing team at ABC want to start running some bundled promotions to see if they can spark this department into life.<br>
                            We've heard that you have been studying Association Rule Learning and wondered if this might help us solve some of these problems.<br>
                            We can provide you with a file of 3,500 alcohol transactions. I don't know what you'll find... but if you could use your magic to help us
                            on the above ideas then this could have a huge impact! Please let us know once you have some results and we can discuss!
                            <br><br>

                            Thanks in advance,<br>

                                    The ABC Grocery Team wants to re-organize their alcohol department as there have been a lot of complaints from the customers lately.
                                    Complaints regarding finding products, finding relevant products, recommendations of the products that the customers must try.<br>
                                    The team is keen on bringing the alcohol department to life and also wants me to provide some strategies to bundle promotions 
                                    around this department. My task is to provide some ideas to the team so that they can spark this department back to life and 
                                    re-organize some proucts.
                                    <b>Association Rule Learning</b> helps in finding interesting and useful information that can be implemented in a business setting, for example bundeled promotions, 
                                    buy product A get product B free or get a discount on B. It can also help grocery owners, stores of similar setting understand which products should be near each other in the store 
                                    in order to make the journey of the customer as easy as possible. Therefore, I will be using <b>Association Rule Learning</b> to accomplish the task assigned.

                                                <li>Association Rule Learning can be implemented using the <b>Apriori Algorithm</b> and this algorithm does not accept data in the form of DataFrame or an Array.
                                                Instead it wants us to provide the data as a list of lists. Therefore, each transaction that I will have will be one list and this list will contain 
                                                one element for each product in that transaction. I will implement these steps to achieve this: </li>

                                                <br>To achieve this - I will 
                                                use the <b>drop</b> functionality of pandas to eliminate this column.</li>

                                                To achieve this - I will use the <b>iterrows()</b> to iterate through all the rows in the DataFrame. Drop the missing values using <b>dropna</b> function and use the <b>append</b> method to append every row to newly declared <b>transaction_list</b>.

                                                    <p>From the above table I can conclude that there is a very strong relationship between the gifts related to alcohol and I would strongly recommend 
                                                        placing alcohol and alcohol gifts together. There is also a relationship between the "small" word and the ABC Grocery marketing team would 
                                                        like to go through this once. This table would be really help the marketing team to find relationship between different products and help place all of these products strategically and try bundling them 
                                                        to get more sales. The customers would then find relevant products at a single place and also find different recommended products after the team has re-organized the alcohol department and products in the store.
